## Description
## Architecture
### Providers
### Database
### Middleware
### Server

## Deployment

<b>IMPORTANT:</b> Arbiter <em>requires</em> the use of yarnpkg (https://yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/install/)

### PM2 Deployment Server Configuration

For clean target environments:
- Have pm2 installed globally
  ```
  yarn global add pm2
  ```
- Must be able to clone from the Arbiter github repo
- A ssh key has been generated specifically for deployment access, the keys has been uploaded to CircleCI, and the public key has been added to the target server's ~/.ssh/authorized_keys
- From a local machine, run the following commands to initialize the pm2 environment on the target server:
  ```
  ./node_modules/.bin/pm2 deploy <environment_key> setup
  ```
  Where <environment_key> is either production or qa, depending on the purpose of the server

### Admin Console
- Installation
  The Forest Admin Lumber microservice points to the database specified in the .env file. To install, first copy
  the .env template, update the values to point to the proper Arbiter database, then run:
  ```
  cd admin/
  yarn install
  cd ..
  ```

- Running
  This will start the Lumber microserver and allow you to hit the ForestAdmin cloud app to access the Admin Console.
  ```
  yarn admin
  ```

### Development
- Installation
  ```
  yarn install
  ```

- Running
  This will build and run the server in watch mode.
  ```
  yarn watch
  ```

  You may also build a developmental image (non-watch) using:
  ```
  yarn build-dev
  ```
  This will build a debug image to the dist/ folder.

### QA
  <em>NOTE:</em> <b>The QA server is production server for all QA server-based logins. Deployments to this server will be off of
  master. If you wish to QA a different branch, then do not use the Deployment step - rather login to the QA server, checkout your repo, and deploy/stat manually.</b>

- Prereqs:

  The target server has been properly configured & initialized.

- Installation & Build
  ```
  yarn install production
  ```

- Running
  Do not run locally. To run on the QA server manually, run:
  ```
  yarn start
  ```

- Deployment
  CircleCI deploys production images to AWS. See circle.yml for more details.

### Production
- Prereqs:

  The target server has been properly configured & initialized.

- Installation & Build
  ```
  yarn install production
  ```

- Running
  Do not run locally

- Deployment
  CircleCI deploys production images to AWS. See circle.yml for more details.

  TODO Deployment
  - do any updates to admin?
